This project implements an add-to-cart feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing primarily on functionality over design. The application includes creating product objects and storing them in an array. Key JavaScript skills applied include selecting DOM elements, dynamically adding product details, and managing the shopping cart's active state by adding and removing classes. The product list initializes on page load, and users can easily add or delete items from the cart. This project emphasizes core programming concepts such as array manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
